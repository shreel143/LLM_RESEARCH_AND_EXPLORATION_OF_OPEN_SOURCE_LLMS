llm response: I'm truly sorry to hear about the challenges you're facing. It sounds like you've been through a lot, and managing twin toddlers on your own can be incredibly demanding. It's important to acknowledge the emotional toll of the loss, break-up, and isolation. I encourage you to consider seeking support, whether through counseling services or local parenting groups where you might connect with others who understand your experiences. Taking small steps toward building a support network can make a positive impact on your well-being. If you're open to it, professional counseling can provide a safe space to process your emotions and develop strategies for coping with the various stressors in your life.

It's a challenging experience when we find it difficult to forgive ourselves, even when our loved ones have forgiven us. It's important to recognize that everyone makes mistakes, and forgiveness, especially of oneself, is a process that takes time. If you're open to it, talking with a mental health professional can provide a supportive space to explore these feelings, understand their roots, and work towards self-forgiveness. Remember that acknowledging your remorse is a crucial step toward personal growth, and seeking guidance can be a positive way to move forward.
