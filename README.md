# LLM_RESEARCH AND EXPLORATION OF OPEN-SOURCE LLMS

This study delves into the exploration of open-source large language models (LLMs), focusing on innovative few-shot learning techniques. The primary concern motivating this research is the growing demand for mental health support, exacerbated by limited resources. Traditional counselling methods, while effective, face challenges in scalability and accessibility. Current technological solutions lack the necessary depth for meaningful mental health interactions.

To address these limitations, our study introduces a unique approach utilizing pre-trained open-source LLMs. We train these models on a specialized prompts based on mental health conversational dataset, capturing authentic interactions between real patients and psychologists. Systematic evaluation of the responses generated by these LLMs, compared to each other and real professionals' responses, is crucial. Our goal is to assess the potential of LLMs as viable substitutes or supplements for mental health counselling, particularly in resource-constrained environments. Preliminary findings reveal promising outcomes, emphasizing the substantial potential of LLMs in effectively addressing mental health challenges and providing valuable insights for future developments in this domain.

Simultaneously, the project explores the broader use of open-source LLMs, specifically investigating prompt-based few-shot learning to overcome challenges in conversational AI training. These findings highlight the promising applications of open-source LLMs in both general conversational AI and the specialized context of mental health support.
